RELATIVE

An application that will be able to compare the weather today with how it was yesterday. Eventually add more
comparisons. This application is written in php and uses jQuery, AJAX and SASS as well. Also experimented with
parallax in css. So far only have yesterdays temperature and the current temperature being returned in Celsius 
from that location. Beware there is minimal error handling. The submit form uses AJAX to return the temperature. 
The temperature is retrieved from forecast.io.
