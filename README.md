RELATIVE

An application that will be able to compare the weather today with how it was yesterday. Eventually add more
comparisons. This application is written in php and uses jQuery, AJAX and SASS as well. Also experimented with
parallax in css. So far only have two input areas for longitude and latitude and it will return the degrees in
Celsius from that location. Beware there is no error handling yet. The submit from the form uses AJAX to return
the temperature. The temperature is retrieved from forecast.io.
