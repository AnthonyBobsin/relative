RELATIVE

An application that compares the weather today with how it was yesterday. Eventually add more
comparisons. This application is written in php and uses jQuery, AJAX and SASS as well. Also experimented with
parallax in css. The data is displayed in graphs using Chartist. The submit form uses AJAX to return the data. 
The picture displayed during scroll is chosen based off of current weather.

The temperature is retrieved from forecast.io.
