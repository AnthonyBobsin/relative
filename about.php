			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>Welcome to Relative. This website is used to recieve and compare data between yesterdays weather
			and todays weather. Whenever I look up the weather for the day, I find myself wanting something to
			relate the numbers to in order to get a general idea of how it feels. By comparing the weather from
			today to yesterday, this website achieves exactly that and gives you a better idea of the weather today
			by relating it to how it was yesterday.</p>
